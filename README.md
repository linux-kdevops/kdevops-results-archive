This is a collection of results for tests run with
[kdevops](https://github.com/linux-kdevops/kdevops)
on different kernels. Each user has their own dedicated
namespace.

This git tree leverages git lfs, what this allow is for you to download
only a smaller version of the repository without the actual tarballs
of the results, you then can decide when and if you need the tarballs
by selectively downloading them with "git lfs fetch --include". As it
stands without LFS if you clone this git tree you'd have to download
218M, if you use GIT_LFS_SKIP_SMUDGE=1 before the clone to avoid downloading
all the files you'd just get a 2.5M directory, for a 98.85% of space savings.

To leverage LFS with an example:

```bash
GIT_LFS_SKIP_SMUDGE=1 git clone https://github.com/linux-kdevops/kdevops-results-archive.git
cd kdevops-results-archive
git lfs fetch --include "fstests/gh/linux-ext4-kpd/20250415/0001/linux-6-15-rc2/8ffd015db85f.xz
git lfs checkout "fstests/gh/linux-ext4-kpd/20250415/0001/linux-6-15-rc2/8ffd015db85f.xz
```

kdevops will automatically make use of the archive if you have it present.
To be clear, you should have both the kdevops and kdevops-results-archive
directory in the same parent directory. Do not put kdevops-results-archive
inside the kdevops directory.

# Submitting results

Please ensure you use `*.xz` tarballs, so, if you're going to push
results, we have a sanity check to ensure you don't push directories
with more than 5 files. To ensure this you can use:

```bash
git config core.hooksPath hooks
```

# Dashboard

Commits pushed to kdevops-results-archive automatically trigger re-generation
of the *entire* kdevops dashboard:

  * [kdevops dashboard](https://kdevops.org)

## Enhancing the dashboard

The dashboard code was generated by an AI agent based on target descriptions
of what we wanted. We have better things to do than to write dashboard code and
so this is meant to be super simple. The dashboard therefore leverages results
*inside* each commit. So if you want to process results, add them to the
commit log. The entire generation of the dashboard takes about 1-2 seconds
to run today, and given we rotate the archive on epochs, it means we'll sustain
this speed over time to make this scalable.

If you want to try to enhance the dashboard, consider using either claude-ai
or github codepilot, they are proving to be the best agents to easily modify
this code. You can just describe what you want to change, and try to demo it
before pushing as follows:

```
rm -rf dashboard;
time ./bin/gen-dashboard.py  -s $(git rev-list --max-parents=0 HEAD)
```

That's it, point your we browser to your local dashboard/index.html and if
it looks like an enhancements just push.

# Seeing tarball contents

To see contents you can use something like:

```
tar -tOJf fstests/mcgrof/xfs/libvirt-qemu/20240505-0001/6.9.0-rc6.xz 2>&1 | grep xfs | grep 033
```

# Seeing fstests results

To see fstests results you can use something like this:

```
tar -xOJf fstests/mcgrof/xfs/libvirt-qemu/20240505-0001/6.9.0-rc6.xz 6.9.0-rc6/xfs_reflink_1024/xfs/033.out.bad
tar -xOJf fstests/mcgrof/xfs/libvirt-qemu/20240505-0001/6.9.0-rc6.xz 6.9.0-rc6/xfs_reflink_1024/xfs/033.dmesg
```
